# CP Problem Tracker ðŸŽ¯

A minimal Chrome extension for competitive programmers to track their daily problem-solving count. Stay consistent, visualize your progress, and never lose track of your daily grind.


## Why?

In competitive programming, consistency is key. Solving problems every single day is the most effective way to improve. This extension was built to be a simple, unobtrusive tool to help you answer one question at the end of the day: "Did I solve a problem today?" By keeping a visible log of your progress, you're more motivated to maintain your streak.
